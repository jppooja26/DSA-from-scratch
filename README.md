# DSA-from-scratch

This repository contains code that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on various data structures. The code is organized in a menu-driven format, allowing users to interactively perform operations on the chosen data structure.

# Data Structures Covered 
The repository includes implementations of the following data structures:

1. Array
2. Matrix
3. String
4. LinkedList
5. Stack

I will keep updating this repository. Feel free to explore the code and learn more about CRUD operations on different data structures! If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out at jppooja03@yahoo.com
